                       <article>
                       As defined by the Webster dictionary, colonialism refers to the “domination of people or area by a 
foreign state or nation: the practice of extending and maintaining a nation’s political and economic 
control over another people or area” (Webster, 2022). By looking at colonialism as the phenomenon 
that took place in Africa – both the historic Eurocentric, and the current neo-colonialism - this paper 
will  investigate  the  colonization  of  Africa.  To  be  more  precise,  we  will  investigate  knowledge 
production and its relation to technological development within Africa, and how  these two aspects 
have been affected by colonialism.

                       <h2>Colonialism in Africa  </h2>
                       <article>
                       With  the  colonization  of  Africa,  the  colonizers  had  two  main  objectives:  first  to  attain  a  political 
dominance over the people of Africa (Ocheni Nwankwo, 2012). As the result of a rivalry between 
the British and the French, Africa’s rich supply of raw materials were seen as a necessity, these two 
countries, as well as others that soon followed, sort to claim as much territory within Africa as possible 
(Ocheni  Nwankwo, 2012). The second reason, after domination was acquired, was to seek methods 
that would allow the colonizers to exploit the people of Africa, as well as abuse anything that she has 
to offer. With the increase of technology and their advanced methods of knowledge production, as 
well as the present exploitations of nations already colonized by them, the Europeans need and desire 
for power and control of those nations were once again reignited, and the source for that need and 
desire was created by the birth of the industrial revolution (Ocheni  Nwankwo, 2012).  
With the increased need to support their nation, Europe introduced new crops to the land of Africa. 
These crops were grown in Africa and taken back to the land of the colonisers. To process these crops 
as well as the raw material extracted on Africa, the colonizers introduced to the people of Africa, new 
technology  that would  allow  them  to  process  these  goods.  Along  with  the  introduction of  this  new 
industry, they also created and introduced constructed roads for transport and improved 
communication.  These  were  however  all  forced  upon  the  nations  of  Africa.  While  the  colonizers 
introduced these “wonderful” ideas and technology to the African economy, they also brought along 
the  idea  of  tax  (Ocheni   Nwankwo, 2012).  In order  for  the  people of  Africa to  remain  under  their 
control, the European powers created tax laws. These tax laws allowed them to force the Africans into 
forced labour and made  it easier for them to steal land from those very same people. Because this worked so well, Africa economy was not allowed to progress further than its current point. The African 
economy  was  forced  to  remain  within  the  area  of  primary  resource  and  agricultural  production  to 
maintain and grow the economy of its colonizers.

                       <h2>Technology and Knowledge Production in Africa </h2>
                       <article>
                       Throughout my research, I have come to understand that the two aspects of technology development 
and knowledge production, are a duo that goes hand in hand. It is the knowledge that we have that 
allows us to develop technologies. Likewise, it is those technologies that allow us to progress further 
and develop new knowledge systems. An example of this in today’s world is the Internet. 
To develop a better understanding of this relation I looked at the paper: “Access to Ghosts”, by Tegan 
Bristow. In her paper, Bristow starts off by saying:  
“African-orientated positions regarding technology cannot be clarified without a closer look at the 
contextual histories that surround them.” (Bristow, 2016, p. 1) 
Likewise, we cannot look at these African technologies and knowledge systems that surrounds African 
cultures  without  looking  at  these  aspects  post-colonialism.  In  her  paper,  Bristow  aims  to  obtain  a 
better understanding within these aspects of technology and knowledge. What I drew out from her 
paper, was the presence of knowledge and technology pre-colonialism. She points out that there has 
been a raise of attention and interest regarding the designs and creations of African patterns, as well 
as the subject of mathematics. Throughout her paper she proves that Africans indeed had their own 
knowledge systems and ways of understanding within the confined boarders of their continent. She 
does this by referencing the work of Ron Eglash (among many other authors and researchers), who 
proves that these pattern designs and creations are far from only holding decorative value, but that 
they also reflect on the present knowledge systems available at that time (Bristow, 2016, p. 2). 
In  her  understanding  of  these  pre-colonial  technologies  and  knowledge  systems,  she  continues  to 
quote anthropologist Bryan Pfaffenberger who notes, “no technology can be said to exist unless the 
people who use it can use it over and over again”. Which then leads her to ask the question of how 
these systems may or have not been maintained (Bristow, 2016, p. 5). 
Europe’s accelerated expansion due to the industrial revolution pushed  Europe  to  impose  their 
technologies and knowledge systems onto Africa and its people.  In  his paper  “Coloniality  of 
Knowledge”, Morgan Ndlovu breaks down this concept of Coloniality. His investigation leads him to 
Anibal Quijano, who developed the concept of “coloniality of knowledge” (Ndlovu, 2018, p. 6). Quijano 
argues that colonialism continues to survive within the domains of knowledge. The concept critics the 
Eurocentric System of Knowledge. To expand on this, it revolves around the ideas of: 
<ul>
    <li>Who creates knowledge and what is the purpose of that knowledge?  </li>
    <li>What  is  the  relevance  and  irrelevance  that,  that  said  knowledge  has  on  the  respective 
cultures? </li>
    <li>How does the knowledge system empower certain individual while disempowering the other? </li>
</ul>
Bristow states that history has proven to us countless times that the consequences of the imposition 
of knowledge systems from foreign cultures to indigenous cultures, especially if indigenous culture is 
unfamiliar with that knowledge system (Bristow, 2016, p. 5) . One of these consequences according 
to  coloniality  of  knowledge  is  the  suppression  of  the  indigenous  knowledge  systems.  The  influence 
that  colonialism  has  had  on  cultures is that of “knowing”, “knowledge production”, “perspectives”, 
etc.  And  this  influence  is  exactly  what  brought  upon  the  suppression  of  knowledge  which  in  turn 
brought upon the destruction of Africa’s technologies, indigenous population, cultures traditions, 
and societies. To quote Ndlovu: “Colonial domination in the sphere of knowledge production has 
played a role of emptying the minds of African subjects of their knowledge and memories but has also 
played a part in implanting foreign ways of knowing and remembering.” (Ndlovu, 2018, p. 95) 
As Bristow has pointed out before, Africa had its own set of knowledge systems, and it is also home 
to some of the earliest forms of mathematics in history (Bristow, 2016, p. 1). Likewise, Edwards Shizha, 
in his paper “African Indigenous Perspectives on Technology”, points out the various African societies, 
their  knowledge  systems,  and  their  technologies  (Shizha,  2016,  p.  47).  These  pre-colonial  societies 
used their various knowledges and put it into the practical by developing technologies around their 
respective knowledge systems. These technologies were appropriate for these societies and was able 
to enhance their way of living at the time.  As we have seen before, the European powers introduced 
colonisation which interfered and destroyed this balance of knowledge and technology within Africa’s 
societies. Shizha quotes, Basil Davidson who argues: “colonialism prevented the potential for natural 
maturing of pre-colonial African institutions” (Shizha, 2016, p. 48). Coloniality of knowledge is what 
allowed the European powers to grow and develop which in turn result in the under development of 
Africa.  Therefore,  when we talk about Africa’s development and their knowledge we have to 
(according  to  Edward  Shizha)  look  at  it  from  the  perspectives  of  its  former,  and  even  current 
colonisers.

<h2>Neo-Colonialism In the Digital and potential Loss of The Internet Freedom </h2>
<article>
Internet freedom, a policy and term used to encompass the concept of ‘freedom of speech’, ‘freedom 
to information’, ‘freedom from internet censorship’ and ‘the right to access the internet’. Throughout 
my research the term “internet freedom” is always accompanied by another, “internet sovereignty”. 
The idea of internet sovereignty speaks of the breaking down of the internet into systems that can be 
governed  by  its  respective  country.  This  term  and  concept  were  developed  and  first  appeared  in  a 
white paper called “The Internet in China” (Gravett, 2020). This paper states that the internet, within 
the Chinese boarders, are under the authority of Chinese sovereignty. As a case study I looked at the 
following paper: “Digital neo-colonialism:  The  Chinese  model  of  internet  sovereignty in Africa” by 
Willem Gravett. The paper speaks of the Chinese efforts to become a ‘Cyber Superpower’ (Gravett, 
2020).The  concept  of  internet  sovereignty  allows  the  Chinese  government  to  place  restriction  on  the 
internet, censor content, remove or block content and data storage. They discovered how to exploit 
the internet. These laws and regulations placed by the state on the internet goes against the idea of 
internet  freedom.  The  case  study  states  that  the  Chinese  government  now  aims  to  transfer  these 
policies on digital technology to its ‘foreign policy’. They do this with the simple strategy of exporting 
technologies across the globe and building relations with those nations. Gravett warns in a statement: 
“Chinese technological penetration in Africa is of a nature to raise the spectre of ‘digital neo-
colonialism’. And that this form of colonialism takes the form of three elements (Gravett, 2020): 

<ul>
    <li>“Advocating Chinese model of ‘internet sovereignty’ in African nations” </li>
    <li>“Exporting authoritarian surveillance technology to African states”</li>
    <li>“Deploying artificial intelligence technology and data-mining techniques across Africa” </li>
</ul>
With consequences of colonialism leaving Africa’s economy in a depressing state. Africa’s economy 
and  industries  are  stuck  at  the  stage  of  only  producing  primary  resources  and  raw  material.  With 
Africa’s technological background hindered, the Chinese government used this opportunity to 
strengthen  its  relations  with  Africa  by  supplying  her  with  technologies  that  their  industries  cannot 
produce  on  a  tertiary  scale.  Resulting  in  the  massive  and  dominant  involvement  of  the  Chinese  in 
Africa’s technological affairs. Gravett argues that the “fact that through its proxies the Chinese 
government  is  the  only  eager  provider  of  finance  for  internet  connectivity  on  the  continent  gifts  it 
significant leverage over African governments”  (Gravett,  2020).  The  influence  the  Chinese  and  its 
policies have on the states of Africa have already begun to show itself. Gravett brings to our attention 
the statement of the Tanzanian deputy minister of communication (Gravett, 2020):  
“Our Chinese friends have managed to block such media in their country and replaced them with 
their home-grown sites that are safe, constructive, and popular. We aren’t there yet, but while we 
are still using these platforms we should guard against their misuse.” 

And  not  only  in  Tanzania,  Gravett  refers  similar  influences  across  Africa(reference).  Despite  the 
exploitation of Africa’s poor state of technological infrastructure, in the end, Chinas role in the 
technological  development  of  Africa  has  proved  to  be  beneficial.  Although  Gravett  urges  African 
government officials to be vigilant and consider advancing their own values and interest before they 
are  influence  by  this  Chinese  model.  He  further  states  that  the  technological  invest  of  the  Chinese 
should not result in the rise of neo-colonial exploitation.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<article>
As I have stated before, “we cannot look at these African technologies and knowledge systems that 
surrounds  African  cultures  without  looking  at  these  aspects  post-colonialism”. Colonialism  has 
affected Africa, culturally, socially and more so economically. With colonialism came a halt to Africa’s 
knowledge  production  and  technological  development.  Colonialism  effect  is  that  of  development 
must equal underdevelopment. For one country to gain another must lose. Africa’s colonial state of 
technology  was  that  of  primary  resource  production,  and  due  to  the  power  and  influence  of  the 
European  nations,  it was  kept  at  this  stage  and  prevented  from  further  progress.  That  explains  the 
state and the role of Africa economy in todays world. As for neo-colonialism, it seems that it is also a 
consequence  and  something  that  lives  on  through  the  legacy  of colonialism.  The  Chinese exploited 
Africa and its weakness which is its recovering state from colonialism. The Chinese saw Africa’s poor 
state of technology and knowledge production and used this to their advantage to gain an influence 
within Africa. In short it is colonialism that makes Africa susceptible to neo-colonialism
