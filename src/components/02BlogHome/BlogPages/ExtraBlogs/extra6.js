            My lastes blog post is also my latest exam submission for my theory course. 
            The exam revovled around the concept of digital fragilty, and this really helped my build onto my understanding
            from the provious blog posts I done on Internet Art. Not only that, it also inpisred my latets net art game prototype, which uses the concept of digotal fragilty.

            When you mentioned you wanted to see how use my net art to engage with the readings, I really hope this is what you meant.
            This course allowed me to engage a whole lot better with the readings across my to courses.
            Which allowed me to create The Conservation od Digital Art game prototype.
