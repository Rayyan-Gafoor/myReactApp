                   <h1>Artificial Resurrection and The Artificial Simulation  of Aura. </h1>
                   <section>
                       <article>
                       During my last analysis on a specific piece of Net.Art, I was left with some unanswered questions. 
This paper serves as a continuation into the analysis of the the Net.Art: The Beyond, create by Zoe 
Beloff (This paper can be found in the Appendix if one wishes to read more on the subject). Beloff is 
an artist, filmmaker and writer and her work often revolves around history, often connecting the 
past and the present, as she states that her purpose is “to illuminate the present through the past” . 
She often explores the idea or rather the relation and history behind psychoanalysis and the 
paranormal. She created the web-based world of “Beyond” to exploit these ideas, along with its 
relation to technology and desire. She states that these ideas serve as an investigation of the 
“Dream Life of Technology”. In this essay we will be exploring the idea of “Aura” and how it relates 
to Net.Art. To be clearer we will be looking more closely at her idea of artificial  resurrection and how 
it relates to Aura.

                      <h2>
                      What  is Aura? 
                      </h2>
                      <article>
                      In his paper “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction”, Walter Benjamin defines 
Aura as the element of “Presence in Time and Space” that a work of art encapsulates. In a sense 
Aura can be seen as the aesthetic of presence which it occupies. But again, Aura can also be seen as 
an experience, as he claims there is a difference between seeing a photograph rather than the actual 
work of art in person. He goes on further and says that our progression and technological advances, 
will result in the destruction of this Aura. He sees Aura as the element of art that cannot be 
reproduced through the mechanical reproduction of a piece of art, hence he despises the idea of 
photography. He belie ves that the birth of photography will result in the end of the era of 
authenticity. The more art is reproduced the less it is “present in time and space”, it loses it 
uniqueness.  
This may come off as subjective, but the definition of Aura is not quite clear to me. It seems to be 
referring to a lot about the art, not just how original it is, but also to its history. Because of this, I 
found myself confused about how it is related to digital art, in this case Net.Art? As seen in my 
previous research into “The Beyond” project, I approached the shallow waters of Aura within the 
Digital Space, and left with one question: 
“How does a digital piece of work, lacking the physical component, carry an Aura?” 
                      </article>
                      <h2>Aura Within  A Digital  Space </h2>
                      <article>
                      It makes sense for one to claim that something physical has lost its originality because it has been 
reproduced one to many times. But what about something that exists only in the digital realm. 
Beloff, goes on to explain that her work could have not been possible without the existence of the 
internet. Which makes sense, it is the only medium in which it could have been experienced. One 
might argue that her virtual world could have also been experienced (the same way we experience a 
museum and its works) in real life, that we could have gone there in person and walked around as 
she explains everything. But no, that is not the case.  We do not only see Beloff, taking us through 
the world with nothing but her voice to guide us and keep us anchored to the real world. She uses 
her voice and film to bring back life into what we  see in this world. From poems to humans that have 
passed on, Beloff, successfully resurrects, or rather artificially resurrects these entities. A “unique” 
experience if I do say so myself. And there is that word again, “unique”.  Something which Aura is 
defined by, but this is a digital piece of work, which exists on a platform with the entire purpose of 
being shared.
                      </article>
                      <h2>What  is The Internet? </h2>
                      <article>Let us take it back to very birthplace of the digital. What is the internet? Why does it exist? Well, 
with a quick definition, the internet, a network that allows computers all over the world to connect, 
built with the purpose for sharing information and communication. Now taking that into 
consideration, sharing in some cases means to reproduce that information, that data and send it to 
someone else. Now we have a copy and so does the next person . So again, I ask another question, If 
it is created on a platform that goes against the laws of Aura, is Net.Art even born with an one? </article>
                      <h2>The Dead Will Rise Again</h2>
                      <article>
                      As I have stated before in my previous paper, Beloff uses her world of “The Beyond” to explore the 
paranormal. “The Beyond” is a place in which the dead can be resurrected and Beloff successfully 
does so, artificially  of course. She does this by diving into the idea posed by Paul Virilio, that it is 
memory that shapes and brings meaning to photography, giving it a sense of Aura. This is where we 
see that in Beloff’s attempt to resurrect the dead, she does this by the simple means of artificially 
simulating its Aura as well. Which lead me to ponder longer on the idea of Aura. What if the Aura is 
not lost at all? Think of Aura as a form of energy which surrounds a work of art, in science they say 
that energy can neither be created or destroyed.  What if this hold true for Aura as well? If we think 
of Walter Benjamin’s theory and how art loses it  Aura the more it is reproduced in terms of energy, 
what if it is not lost, but rather it just depreciates in one form and is then transferred and allowed to 
exist through different means? 
                      </article>
                      <h2>Aura Within  the Art of Games </h2>
                      <article>
                      Taking another step back, we look at the reason in the previous paper to why I chose “The Beyond” 
to analyse. Simply because it was a work of art that resembled a game something which I am familiar 
with. So, while thinking of this project as a game along with the concept of Aura and reproduction, I 
kept thinking of scenarios in which I thought a game had lost its aura. Two concepts which most of 
the time has a very thin line dividing them in game development are theft and inspiration. Stealing 
another game’s idea and using it as your own or looking at that game for inspiration and developing 
your own ideas around its original concept. Once again, this may come off as subjective, but I believe 
that regardless of which happens to an original game, theft, or inspiration, it somehow holds onto if 
not increases it current state of Aura.  
If someone attempts to copy and steal an idea of a good game, it only increases the original’s status. 
Take Candy Crush for instance, I remember how people were crazy about the game, I to found 
myself hooked to my phone. It was “super addictive”. And not long after its rise to fame, the 
copycats began to pop up. Because, I was so addicted, I wanted more, something else that could 
bring this same rush of hearing “Sweet!” or “Sugar Crush!”, and I ended up downloading these other 
games. Although, after playing one or two games, I did not feel the same rush which made me go
back to Candy Crush. This is when I realized how low-quality copycats actually leaves us yearning for 
more of the original.  
Looking at it from an inspirational side, when I game successfully uses another games concept, or 
mechanic, I often found myself still praising the older game. Why, simply because I acknowledged it. 
The same way Beloff’s “The Beyond” project receives praise for its virtual reality experience and how 
it has paved the way for the projects that came after.

                      <h2>The Death of Aura </h2>
                      <article>
                      And so, I confront you with another question: Is Walter Benjamin’s theory on Aura Dead? I certainly 
thought his entire paper was while reading it, both in the sense of boredom and his theories, but 
perhaps I may have also misunderstood what he was actually trying to say. Nevertheless, we look 
back at “The Beyond”. As we have mentioned before “The Beyond” cannot exist outside the realm of 
the web. And like we have said, the web’s entire purpose is to share, communicate and essentially 
reproduce digitally, something which poses a threat to the existence of Aura. So how is it possible 
that Beloff has successfully resurrected something in which it can not live. Confusing, maybe, maybe 
not. Benjamin referred to Aura as the “Here and Now”, the moment, the experience, the history 
behind the entity. So how does this differ when considering and looking at the physical compared to 
the digital? Moving through “The Beyond” I kept asking myself this question and kept coming to a 
dead end which left me unsatisfied. If I couldn’t find a reasonable difference, perhaps I had to look 
for a reasonable similarity. Browsing the internet, moving through the world of “The Beyond”, I 
thought this seemed too natural, as if moving through this world had become of second nature to 
me. Is this not me experiencing something new in the moment? Is this world not occupying a space, 
perhaps not physical but still a space?  I could only answer yes to both these questions. Yes, I was 
experiencing something new in that moment, but why did it become so natural for me to navigate 
through this world. I have become immersed within this realm of “The Beyond”. 
What makes me, walking through a museum, making the various decisions of where and when to go, 
deciding to turn left or right, stopping to observe or choosing to ignore, so different from moving or 
browsing through the internet, yet alone this world of “The Beyond”. When we navigate the web, 
we make the choices, sometimes we spiral down the rabbit whole going deeper and deeper into 
whatever we on the internet. But we are in control, we are aware .So, to me, there is no difference. Browsing becomes the “Here and Now”, it forms part of the unique 
experience. In her world and her means of artificial  resurrection of the dead, Beloff, proves to me 
that Aura is not a unique or rare quality that surrounds only the physical art. And so, I argue that 
Benjamin’s theory is indeed dead, or maybe just incorrect. I believe that it is through these means of 
reproduction that Aura is allowed to exist within the digital, reproduction serves as the means of a 
source for Aura. In terms of Digital reproduction, the more something is shared and experienced, the 
greater the Aura is that surrounds that space. With the URL or every piece serving as both the “Here 
and Now” as well as the symbol that’s signifies its originality. Simply by looking at Aura in the same 
way Walter Benjamin does, we can oppose his theory. Net.Art has a space, it gives us an experience, 
it is both what Benjamin defines to have an Aura as well as what he contradicts about Aura. Zoe 
does this by using various forms of art in her world, digitally manipulating the images with these 
various art forms, reproducing them throughout. But it is through her attempt of artificially 
resurrecting these artifact and entities that she meets and satisfies the requirements for Walter 
Benjamin’s theory. This also proves that Aura is not lost, but rather transferred to exist in one form 
different from the other. Zoe Beloff, does this by taking something which we would have argued had 
lost its aura and creates a completely new function around it, allowing it to be experienced through 
something new.
