                   <h1>Cognitive Biases in Among Us </h1>
                   <section>
                       <h2>What is Among Us?</h2>
                       <article>
                       Among is an online multiplayer, ‘social deduction’ game, released in June 2018, created by 
the developers of InnerSloth (Among Us, n.d.). The game is set in space, having players take 
on one of two roles, crewmate or imposter. Crewmates play as members of a spaceship 
crew, performing tasks to repair their destroyed ship. The catch to this however is that the 
imposter is ‘among’ them. The imposters’ goal is simple: “Kill off the crew”. It is up to the 
crewmates to determine who the imposter is while trying to stay alive. I will investigate the 
choice of colours players choose before the game starts and how that affects gameplay 
experience. Which leads us to this the choice of cognitive bias I have chosen to relate to the 
game.

                       <h2>The Confirmation Bias </h2>
                       <article>
                       Confirmation bias is “our underlying tendency to notice, focus on, and give greater credence 
to evidence that fits with our existing beliefs” (Confirmation Bias, n.d.). According to “The 
Decision Lab”, this form of bias occurs because our brains tend to use shortcuts. In his book, 
“Thinking Fast and Slow”, Daniel Kahneman refers to “Two Systems” (Kahneman, 2013). 
System 1 and 2. System 1 is what we will focus on, the “gut feeling” that we all experience at 
some point during these social deductive games. These shortcuts or System 1 tend to lead 
our focus toward information that will validate our preconceptions. This mental shortcut 
falls under what we call heuristics. Hence why we will investigate the impact of colour as a 
grounding for these heuristics, and its influence on confirmation bias.  
In the study “The relationship between color and emotion”, Naz Kaya, explores and 
discusses the association between colour and emotion, and continues to reference 
researchers such as Dr Hemphill along with hist studies. Kaya, states that it is widely 
recognized that colours have an influence on our emotions (Kaya, 2004). And as a designer, I 
have recently also experimented with the use of colours in my designs, attempting to design 
around the intended emotions I want to invoke within the user. Examples of this are how: 
red is associated with power or how pink is associated with passion.  
In the “Among Us” community these colours have also been associated with roles and 
character traits. This shows the influence these colours have had on players, like how 
everyone always suspects red (see this Reddit post ). These stereotypes that are generated 
because of colour, already prove that not all crewmates are created equally. It is these 
heuristics that lead to the confirmation bias we experience while playing the game.  
In “The Psychology of video games”, Celia Hodent, uses the first two chapters of the book to 
discuss the psychology behind making games. Hodent, states that: “Attention is affected by 
our motivations and emotions” (Hodent, 2021). She further goes on to discuss how our 
brains process information by looking at certain aspects: 
                       </article>
                       <ul>
                           <li> Perception: “We do not perceive reality as it is. Rather, perception is a subjective 
construct of the mind.” (Hodent, 2021) She states that perception is about how we 
use these heuristics to quickly understand our environment, patterns or in this case 
the colours and immediately recognize potential threats. </li>
                           <li>Memory: “Memory is the process by which we encode information” (Hodent, 2021).  
Like all games, we learn as we experience. It is these specific experiences that 
produce a form of stimulus which in turn is stored. These memories can influence 
how we experience a game the next time we play it. These memories allow the 
system 1, Kahneman refers to, to feed us information that influences our 
confirmation bias.  </li>
                           <li>Emotions: ”state of physiological arousal that can also involve the cognition related 
to it” (Hodent, 2021). As we have stated before these colours trigger certain 
emotions within us, and it is these same emotions that help us make the right 
decisions in order to survive, but at the same time they can also trick us into making 
irrational decisions.  </li>
                           <li>Attention: “allows us to focus our information-processing resources on a small 
number of stimuli” (Hodent, 2021). Selective attention ties in well with confirmation 
bias as we focus on information that validate our beliefs. The same thing can be said 
for how we choose to ignore information because it goes against our beliefs.  </li>
                       </ul>
                       <h2>Scenario</h2>
                       <article>
                       During a gaming session of among us, I experienced what I did not know at the time to 
be a ‘confirmation bias’. I played as white and befriended the player ‘Pink’. When the 
first game started, pink and I were inseparable (confirmation bias 1 Reddit). We won the 
first game.  
In the next game, however, I was the imposter, and with pink again by my side, it made 
it difficult to kill. If I killed pink (which I could not do because I felt bad) already people 
would draw the conclusion that it was me, because Pink never left my side. However, if I 
killed anyone else pink would see, and most likely report me. Contemplating what to do, 
someone called an emergency meeting, and to no surprise, someone pointed out 
red(confirmation bias 2 Reddit). As the game progressed, I eventually ended up killing 
someone, Pink then blamed someone else who was also in the room despite me being 
closer to the body, reported and accused them (confirmation bias 3). Pink realised after 
that her accusation was false, called another meeting and said: “vote me ”. After Pink 
left, I was able to manipulate the rest, except black, perhaps there is some truth in black 
being the “best detective”. 
Pink’s memory of me as well as the information they thought they had on me, 
influenced the entire second playthrough. She refused to acknowledge that I was the 
killer and immediately looked for some other kind of evidence in the room which was 
the presence of the other player. After realising the truth Pink could not accept me 
being the killer and volunteered to be ejected. Later in lobby Pink claimed that they 
refused to believe that I was the imposter and would rather have died.

                       <article>
                       While doing research I came across two realisations:  
                       <ol>
                           <li>
                           The scenario described above also has other biases such as : 
                           <ul>
                               <li>Bandwagon Effect- the accusation of red without valid evidence. </li>
                               <li>Illusion of Validity - Pink believed her preconception to be valid. </li>
                               <li>Halo Effect – Pink’s view on who I was refused to change, because of the first 
game.  </li>
                           </ul>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                           That through all my research, not only in this paper, I could have been influenced by 
this confirmation bias, by looking for information that validates my idea of colours 
and their influence on our experience.  
                           </li>
                       </ol>
